# Prometheus Exporter Packages

This project aims to provide a better installation and configuration experience for Prometheus exporters of `nri-prometheus`.
It packages several open-source Prometheus exporters together with a binary that translates the input data into
the specific format needed by the exporters and the `nri-prometheus` integration triggering their execution.

All native packages are available for installation in New Relic's public repositories.

## Basic architecture of prometheus based integrations 

With respect to "standard" integrations the ones based on prometheus do not collect the data anymore from
the service, but they leverages the configuration protocol in order to register both `nri-prometheus` and an exporter
(if the service does not expose directly prometheus metrics).

This repository provides a way to create packages to install the exporters, and an additional binary used to configure 
and trigger the execution of both `nri-prometheus` and the installed exporters.

## Installation
Before installing any of the exporters, be sure to read the documentation for the specific exporter you want to install.
Each exporter may have specific configuration options that will require you to modify to make it work for your environment.

Also make sure you read the documentation about the [Infrastructure agent](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent). 
The agent, in conjunction with our [Prometheus Open Metrics integration](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-prometheus), 
is the component responsible for sending the metrics, provided by the exporter, to New Relic.

- Ubuntu, Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install <exporter package name>
```

- Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, RHEL, CentOS

```bash
sudo yum install <exporter package name>
```

- SLES

```bash
sudo zypper install <exporter package name>
```

## Local Build and Test

Make sure you have installed:
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

There are Make targets that help you build and run e2e tests locally:

* Compile an integration:
```bash
make fetch-resources-<exporter_name>
make build-<exporter_name>
```

* Run End to End test:
```bash
make test-e2e-<exporter_name> \
  ACCOUNT_ID=<NEWRELIC_ACCOUNT_ID> \
  API_KEY=<NEWRELIC_API_KEY> \
  LICENSE_KEY=<NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY>
```

### nri-config-generator
`nri-config-generator` folder contains all the code needed to build a binary capable to get as input the classical 
user configuration and as output a register protocol sample that will trigger in the agent the execution of:
 - `nri-prometheus` with the needed configuration (port, ignore rules, targetURL, etc)
 - the exporter with the specific configuration needed. Note that this is not needed if the monitored technology is 
exporting prometheus metrics natively.

All the integrations share the same code since the different configurations are passed using the `//go:embed` directive.

In particular the configuration injected is the integration configuration stored under `./exporters/{exporterName}`

### How can I track down different versions?

Since there are a lot of moving pieces it can be difficult data to understand what is actually
running in the environment checking only newrelic.
Each metric will be decorated with the following common attributes:
 - "instrumentation.name": "nri-powerdns", (name of integration)
 - "instrumentation.version": "0.0.2", (version of integration)
 - "collector.name": "infrastructure-agent",  (binary sending data to the backend, in standalone nri-prometue it is nri-prometheus itself)
 - "collector.version": "1.19.2", (version of collector)

The version of nri-prometheus can be retrieved from the agent one since they are package together.
The version of the exporter can be retrieved from the integration version for the same reason

The data regarding the integrations are passed by configuration as metadata to nri-prometheus.

### Adding a new exporter

In order to add a new exporter create a new folder `./exporters/{exporterName}` with the needed files, you can refer to
the `powerdns` as an example.

In each folder we expect to find:
  - `exporter.yml`: definition of the exporter
  - `build.sh` a bash script that will generate the exporter binary under `exporters/{exportername}/target/bin/`
    Notice that this is needed if in the definition of the exporter package_linux=true
  - `win_build.ps1` a powershell script that will generate the windows exporter binary under `exporters/{exportername}/target/bin/`
    Notice that this is needed if in the definition of the exporter package_windows=true
  - `{exporterName}-config.yml.sample` containing the configuration sample for the Infrastructure Agent to run the exporter
  - `{exporterName}.json.tmpl` containing the integration configuration mappings loaded with the `//go:embed` directive.
  - `{exporterName}.prometheus.json.tmpl` (Optional) containing the nri-prometheus configuration mappings loaded with the `//go:embed` directive. If this file is not present, the default file `config.json.tmpl` located under `nri-config-generator/templates/default` will be used.
  - Optionally if the exporter requires any external config files these can also be added by including the files suffixed with a `.tmpl` extension. Read [Adding external config files](#external-files) for more information. 

The definition file requires the following fields:
```yaml
# name of the exporter, should match with the folder name
name: powerdns
# version of the package created
version: 0.0.2
# Relative path to the License path from the repository root
exporter_license_path: LICENSE
# URL to the git project hosting the exporter

config_guid: 86733900-4e10-478c-9633-61595d0e7acb
```

When added open a PR and once merged to master a github action workflow will start building and uploading packages to Github. 

 - In case one exporter definition has been modified or added the exporter will be released for the os requested and a Github release will be created
 - In case more than one exporter definitions have been modified the pipeline fail.

Please notice that exporters have their own `build` script but they share the packaging scripts, located under `./scripts`

### <span id="external-files">Adding external config files</span>

When an exporter requires its own config files and does not accept passing the configuration either by CLI arguments or Environment variables, you can add external config files to the exporter definition.

For example, if an exporter requires a `config.toml` configuration file, you can add it by including a `config.toml.tmpl` file together with the other templates described above. This file will also be templated with values from the integration `{exporterName}-config.yml`. To include that file on the build, declare it on the `exporter.yml` definition file under the `exporter_config_files` setting:

```yaml
# (Optional) Exporter external config files (multiple files can be added separated by commas. i.e. file1,file2)
exporter_config_files: config.toml
```

By default, the external config files will be templated and saved on the TEMP folder. If you want to specify a custom location for the external files you can do so by setting `exporter_files_path` in your exporter configuration file.

Passing the location of the config file to your exporter can be done on the `exporter.json.tmpl` by adding the expected flag and setting its value to the `exporter_files_path` and config filename. For example:

```yaml
{
    "exec": [
        "{{ .exporter_binary_path }}",

        "--config",
        "{{.exporter_files_path}}/config.toml",
    ]
}
```
