# Pipeline: nri-config-generator
# The purpose of this pipeline is guarantee that the code in the config-generator is correct
# Actually this project is used to build different executables depending on the integrations
# Although this code doesn't create a excutable at all, we need to ensure the following steps:
#  - golang-lint: Static analysis of the code
#  - test-nix: Run tests in a *nix environment
#  - test-windows: Run tests in a windows environment
